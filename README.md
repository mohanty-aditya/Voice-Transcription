If you want you can use directly my google collab code for running it online which would produce desirable solution

If you are using it in your own desktop locally then few things should be preinstalled in your computer
    ffmpeg -https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-ffmpeg-on-windows/ 
    The link provides the 5 steps to setup ffmpeg

All the other files are included in the code which arent be requires to be downloaded again manually

But since locally it won't allow to run the microphone it would be highly recommended to use it on collab .
